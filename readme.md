# ML Zoomcamp - Module 1 Homework

## Project Overview
This repository contains the homework assignment for Module 1 of the ML Zoomcamp course. The assignment focuses on data analysis using Python's data science ecosystem, particularly Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations.

## Homework Objectives
- Set up a Python environment for data science work
- Practice data exploration and analysis with real-world datasets
- Work with missing values and data cleaning
- Implement basic linear regression calculations
- Develop proficiency with Pandas and NumPy operations

## Dataset
The homework uses the **Car Fuel Efficiency Dataset** which contains information about various car attributes including:
- Engine specifications (displacement, cylinders, horsepower)
- Vehicle characteristics (weight, acceleration, model year)
- Fuel efficiency metrics
- Origin and fuel type information

## Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/zerubabel/Desktop/ML-Zoom-Camp/Module_01
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
   ```

## Files Description

- `homework_solution.py` - Main solution script for the homework assignment
- `explore_data.py` - Data exploration and analysis script
- `q7_solution.py` - Focused solution for the linear regression question

## Homework Tasks
The assignment covers several key data analysis tasks:
- Environment setup and package version checking
- Basic dataset exploration and statistics
- Handling missing values in datasets
- Filtering and aggregating data by categories
- Statistical analysis of numerical columns
- Linear regression implementation from scratch
